object of this hook is undefined at first for few seconds then it's defined so I can't use it to texture the model here is the code of the hook :\\n\\nimport { NearestFilter, TextureLoader, RepeatWrapping } from 'three'import { useEffect,useState } from 'react';export const useTexture = () =&gt; {const \\\\[textures, setTextures\\\\] = useState({});useEffect(() =&gt; {const textureNames

textureLoader.load(\\\\`images/${name}.jpg\\\\`);texture.magFilter = NearestFilter;loadedTextures\\\\[name\\\\] = texture;});setTextures(loadedTextures);}, \\\\[ \\\\]);return textures;};\\n\\nand here is the code to set the texture:\\n\\nimport {usePlane} from \\\"@react-three/cannon\\\"\\n\\nimport {useTexture} from \\\"../images/textures\\\"\\n\\nimport { useLoader } from
